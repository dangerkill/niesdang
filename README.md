Abstract

Introduction: the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is a database that contains adverse event reports, medication error reports, and product quality complaints resulting in adverse events that were submitted to FDA. So I’m seeking the reaction of drugs that made many people die. I expected with all my effort I will find some clues that what drugs have a negative effect on patients. So that drugs companies can fix their drug formulation or change their ingredient. I chose 2018 but the data was really big and my computer can’t handle the massive amount of data so I decided to run one quarter instead. This data is public data so they were covering some important information such as patients addresses, patients race, patients behaviors, etc… which can be really helpful to find the pattern of patients. This data have a lot of Duplicates, Null values, and outliers. I need to work with it carefully because that really needs to be properly cleaned. I will apply some statistical methodologies and machine learning to this data set after finished the preprocessing step.

Objective: This study was conducted to analyze the reaction of Adverse events in
2018. We want to run some statistical tests and machine learning to find the answer that what drug caused the patient's death?.

Methods: We will study how to separate queries choose what attributes are important and run some statistical tests on it such as Odd ratio, Chisquare, and fisher test. After doing that we will apply machine learning to it. I’m thinking about using unsupervised learning for patients to classify the patient’s groups but It depends on the result of preprocessing step. Finally, we will use a supervised study to build a predictive model on patients so we can understand and find any other reason why patients died.
