Abstract

Introduction:
the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is a database that contains adverse event reports, medication error reports, and product quality complaints resulting in adverse events that were submitted to FDA. So I’m seeking the reaction of drugs that made many people die. I expected with all my effort I will find some clues that what drugs have a negative effect on patients. So that drugs companies can fix their drug formulation or change their ingredient. I chose 2018 but the data was really big and my computer can’t handle the massive amount of data so I decided to run one quarter instead. This data is public data so they were covering some important information such as patients addresses, patients race, patients behaviors, etc… which can be really helpful to find the pattern of patients. This data have a lot of Duplicates, Null values, and outliers. I need to work with it carefully because that really needs to be properly cleaned. I will apply some statistical methodologies and machine learning to this data set after finished the preprocessing step.
